## Which Came First

This is a series of things that happened (e.g. historical events, album releases, technological inventions, product releases, etc)

### Adjusting the difficulty of questions

We want to make sure that we don't pick events which are too far apart. For example, "World War 1 (1914) vs The first iPod (2007)" is too easy, because it is clear that there is such a great distance between them. However, something like "The first iPod (2007) vs Facebook (2004)" might be a bit more difficult because they are closer together. Having said that, the farther in the past the events are, the greater distance they can have between them. For example, "The light bulb (1874-ish) vs The telegram (1834)" might be equally as difficult, despite the far greater time distance between them. This is due to the fact that they are from a longer time ago. I guess because they are not from our lifetime, we have to go purely on our perceptions, rather than remembering when it occured.

### File Format

<table>
	<tr>
		<th>Name (of the event/album/etc)</th>
